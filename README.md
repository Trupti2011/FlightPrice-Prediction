Flight Price Prediction Using Adavanced Machine Learning

1)Perform Feature Engineering
2) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tasks
3)Compare independent features with Target feature to check the 
impact on price
a) Which airline has the highest price 
b) Check if the business class flights are high price or low and find 
only those flights which price is higher than 50k
4)Perform encoding for the required features according to the data
5)Build multiple model by using different algorithm such as Linear 
Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest etc. and check the 
performance of your model.
